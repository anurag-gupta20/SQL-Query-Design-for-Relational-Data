üìò Repository Overview  
This repository presents a curated collection of advanced SQL exercises designed around realistic data models across multiple domains. Each script focuses on schema creation, data population, and query logic ranging from foundational operations to complex subqueries and multi-table joins.

üîç File Descriptions  
1) SQL_Exercise_01.sql ‚Äî Product & Manufacturer Database
- Designs a product catalog with manufacturer relationships. Exercises cover:

- Joins between related entities
- Price-based filtering, discount computation
- Data modification operations (INSERT, UPDATE)

2) SQL_Exercise_02.sql ‚Äî Employee & Department Analysis
- Explores HR-related data by linking employees with departmental budgets. Key topics:
- Multi-condition filtering, DISTINCT usage
- Budget aggregation, department reassignment
- Subqueries to extract hierarchical insights (e.g., second-lowest budget)
- Deletion and update scenarios

3) SQL_Exercise_03.sql ‚Äî Warehouse Inventory System
- Models a logistics warehouse and box inventory environment. Practice includes:
- Average and conditional aggregation per location
- Saturation detection (capacity vs. occupancy)
